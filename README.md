# Trax Launch for Moodle

> This plugin lets you add a remote xAPI content into your Moodle courses.


## Installation

1. Install and configure the right version of 
[Trax Logs](https://github.com/trax-project/moodle-trax-logs) for your Moodle.

2. Download the last version of [Trax Launch](https://github.com/trax-project/moodle-trax-launch/releases).

3. Drag and drop the ZIP file in `http://my-moodle-address.com/admin/tool/installaddon/index.php`. 
For a manual installation, unzip the ZIP file in `my-moodle-install-folder/mod` 
and rename the plugin folder as `traxlaunch`. Be sure that all the plugin files 
are located at the root of the `my-moodle-install-folder/mod/traxlaunch` folder.

4. Go to the Moodle administration area. The presence of the plugin will be detected.

5. Confirm the plugin installation and follow the configuration process.

That's all. Now you can edit a course and add a **Trax Launch** activity.
